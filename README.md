기상청 2025 날씨 빅데이터 콘테스트 주제2

## 📌 Project Description

This project aims to forecast emergency 119 call volumes based on fire incident records and weather big data. By analyzing patterns in weather (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind) and past fire response data, the model can help improve emergency preparedness and resource allocation.

## 📊 Data Sources

- Fire incident data from fire departments or open public data portals
- Weather data from national meteorological services (e.g., KMA, NOAA)

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and integration
- Feature engineering from temporal and weather variables
- Time-series or regression-based prediction model
- Visualization of historical and predicted call trends

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 📁 Structure
